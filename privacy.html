<h1>Privacy policy and cookies of Xchange Up</h1>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer browser from a website's 
computer and is stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences 
allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only allows a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies

to use. Users can set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. 
If you set your computer not to receive cookies, this will mean that some websites will not function and certain personalised features cannot 
be provided to you. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
